The problem statement that we worked under was the category 'Health Problems' and we specifically chose the 'Hospitals/Departments Data Management System'
Its a Web app that allows multiple hospitals and departments to update their data, while Super Admins can monitor it in real-time through the HDMS 
Moreover the super admin will be able to manipulate the data entered across all the different hospitals and departments
We built a simple UI that is easy to understand
With the added fucntionality of toggling Light/Dark mode
The data is intensively stored and can be seen, once the Hospital/Departmental Staff login with their respective credentials
Last but not the least, we used HTML,CSS and Javascript for this project

Hope this project is insightful to the people out there :)
